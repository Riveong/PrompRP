       " 'My Health Anxiety Story and How I am Recovering Hello /r/HealthAnxiety!\\n\\nAllow me to tell you my health anxiety story and how I am beginning to recover from this psychological illness!\\n\\nThe first precursor to my health anxiety was probably almost a year ago to the date when I felt a bump on my shoulder, which I thought was a tumor. Of course, it ended up being a deeply embedded pimple or cyst and resolved on its own after I went to the doctor who said the same thing. When I went into full-blown panic mode was back in April when I woke up with two puncture marks on my ankle after staying the night at a sister\\'s house. Knowing that they once had an issue with a bat in the attic, I assumed that a magical bat had made its way all the way downstairs, embedded itself in the bowels of my sister\\'s house, and bit me on the ankle. Of course, this magical bat must have had rabies too. Spoiler warning, but I did not die of rabies and am not writing this as a ghost.\\n\\nMy health anxiety probably climbed into a hysteria that consumed me last June. I was going to a university field station when I fell ill. Really ill. Not being able to keep down food or water for three days ill. Thus, I flew home as I had missed much of the class and assumed that I was going to die and wanted to so around family. Yet, again, I did not die, but the ordeal had traumatized me enough to sink into full-time paranoia that I would not escape until October.\\n\\nExcept for the occasional stomach ache things were fine for a month from a physical perspective, but from a mental perspective (if thinking I had terminal skin cancer from a 2mm mole was any indication) I was in rough shape. \\n\\nIn mid-July, I developed the first sign of a rare birth defect that I did indeed end up having. Now, before you go into a google symptom, allow me to explain what happened: my belly button burst open. It was not painful as I didn\\'t know this had occurred for an hour. It wasn\\'t until I looked down and saw that my outie had turned into a popped inside outie. I walked to the hospital and was diagnosed with cellulitis and told to go to a follow-up with the university doctors. Ultrasound showed nothing. It was only after a CT scan two months later that they saw a 1\"x2\"x3\" sinus and cyst located behind and below my belly button. The operation was a success and it was removed two months ago. I even got an innie out of the ordeal. In between July and October I had been tested for just about anything and the only thing that came up were elevated liver enzymes and a weird-ass belly button.\\n\\nIn the meantime, I had begun CBT and doubled my dosage of Celexa (which is now down), which helped a lot. Besides teaching me mindful thinking, my therapist became a good outlet to just talk about life and my general grievances that I had been experiencing as a graduating senior from a top state university.\\n\\nTo err on the side of caution, my PCP sent me to a liver specialist to get my liver checked out. They tested me for any liver ailment you can think of, and the only weird thing was my beta globulins- ever so slightly out of range (think 0.1 out of range when usually 1 or 2 out of range indicates an actual problem). Wanting to be as thorough as possible, the pathologist recommended a Bence-Jones Test for leukemias myelomas, and pre-leukemia. The test came back negative. Specialist ruled that it was just an off result due to my immune system still recovering from surgery about two and a half weeks before and I had had no other symptoms consistently. This final test was taken after Christmas break and ordered before it so despite being told I did not have a deadly illness, I stewed over it.\\n\\nAnd then, something happened. Something clicked in my head. I was sick of being prodded at and tested. I looked at my medical information logs for every time I visited the doctor and whenever I was with anyone but my PCP, my blood pressure jumped thirty points and pulse went up to 90bpm over 70. Living in America, I realized that doctors will NEVER stop running medical tests unless they are sure they have ruled out a condition. They don\\'t want to get sued and if you have the insurance or money WILL run a test if you are insistent enough. This all hit me in about 24 hours. I decided that should that final test come back negative that I would only go to the doctor if anything were seriously and obviously wrong or for my psychiatric check-ups. I only google things five minutes a day and I do not talk to my doctors over the patient portal- only at appointments.\\n\\nMy status has improved tremendously these past two and a half weeks. I wanted to tell you guys that there is hope, and what you likely suffer from is a psychological issue. It really is. In seven months the only weird things they could find was:\\n-Elevated liver enzymes, likely prescription or slight fatty liver after a huge barrage of tests\\n-Maybe some gallbladder sludge/stone\\n-Weird-ass belly button thing where if you had it would be very obvious or already addressed in your childhood (having it through adulthood so unlikely that they like to write case studies on it)\\n\\nAnd guess what? These were and are all very treatable. I came back here to post to tell you guys that it can get better. I felt a twinge in my upper right abdomen and got a little panicked tonight but this was the first time I felt even remotely worried about something in the last two weeks. I don\\'t know if it\\'ll take therapy, different meds, getting sick of tests, or all three, but you can get there. Don\\'t give up.',\n",

       " 'Anxiety med. that\\'s not an antidepressant? Hello! \\n\\nI have always been anxious, and as of 2-3 years ago, I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I\\'ve been in therapy for years and tried all sorts of medications (Lexapro, Zoloft, medical marijuana, CBD, Valium, Klonopin, Xanax, Amitriptyline), and the only thing that worked were the benzos. I\\'m extremely lucky to have an NP who fills my Xanax refills. The problem is... I don\\'t want to be addicted to this medication. I take it very sparingly, which is why it works so well, but I only take these when I feel nauseous/jittery/panicky, which, fortunately, is not 24/7. However, I do have GAD pretty bad. In the shower, thoughts just race and I can\\'t find the \"off\" switch. It\\'s ruined my sleep. It\\'s taken a dump on my memory. I just cannot live like this anymore. \\n\\nMeditations help in the moment I do them, but I feel like I need to be medicated. I was on Zoloft for about 6 months, and it helped tremendously, but when I tried getting back on it (I properly titrated my dose when I get off them), for some reason the side effects were extremely unbearable. Granted, I started back at 50mg, when before I was on it for 25mg for a week and then 50mg the second week and continued for 4-6 weeks. It could also be that at the time I could tolerate medical marijuana, but now, that makes me either anxious/jittery or straight-up nauseous. \\n\\nLexapro? Forget it. I started at 10mg, and that was a nightmare. I was so nauseous by day 2, if it wasn\\'t for my anti-nausea med, I would\\'ve projectile vomitted all over my kitchen floor. The other time I was at 5mg, and I felt so cracked out. \\n\\nI also don\\'t like that SSRIs are rough on my body for 4-6 weeks. Maybe that\\'s just the gamble you take, but I hate having increased anxiety, inability to ejaculate, and horrendous stomach pains for a month. Does that sound like fun to anyone? \\n\\nI took amitriptyline, and that was more for chronic pain, and it barely did anything, and as for anxiety, I didn\\'t notice much of a difference either, and I tried this medication at 10 and 25mg.\\n\\nI have an appointment with my NP tomorrow, and she is well aware I struggle with anxiety. Is there a medication that\\'s not an antidepressant that works for GAD and is not a benzo, meaning I can take as often as needed? \\n\\nI\\'ve also tried supplements like L-Theanine, Melatonin, and Ashwagandha, and they don\\'t do crap. \\n\\nAny experiences with non-antidepressants that worked for you?',\n",

       " 'Anxiety/Antsy 2 weeks Post-Op Septoplasty/Turbinate Reduction - Need Support Hi all! \\n\\nFirst time poser here. I am a healthy 28 y/o Male who recently just had a Septoplasty/Turbinate reduction 15 days ago. I am a very active guy and usually very \"chill\" and outgoing. \\n\\nFor those of you who don\\'t know what that is, it\\'s for a deviated septum and you have splints up your nose for a week with a ton of congestion and basically can\\'t do anything while recovering but sit at home (I live by myself with family close by). \\n\\nDue to the surgery, I was instructed to not be super active for 2-3 weeks (I am a runner and take boxing classes). So far my nose and breathing feels fine and is healing normally, but the past few days I have been experiencing super anxiety/restlessness/antsy behavior that I have never experienced before in my life. Let me explain a bit.\\n\\n8 days ago I got the \"splints\" removed from my nose and had a minor complication the day after where my nose bled for 5-6 hours and I went to the ER and they packed it with the most painful \"rhino rocket\" thing up my nose that was the most pain I have experienced in my life. I immediately saw my ENT 6 hours later and she took it out and was pissed they didn\\'t contact her (it was 3am). She said everything looks fine and is healing correctly and gave me the number to call if anything like that happens so she can be contacted.\\n\\nI got relief that day and was able to take a nap/sleep but the next day I got a migraine I tried to wait out that kept me up all night but ended up taking my imitrex to relieve it. A few days later I got oral thrush (didn\\'t know until the end of the day on Sunday when my Uncle told me what it was an not super serious) with a swollen uvula where I felt as if there was \"something stuck in my throat\" and driving me crazy.\\n\\nOn Sunday I think everything just hit me at once: not being able to workout, being cooped up in my house, the whole trauma of the bloody nose incident, the swollen uvula driving me nuts and not healing as fast as I wanted to, living alone with my dog, etc. I started pacing and my mind was racing to the point where I was like do I need to go to the ER for anxiety or do I need to call my doctor? I have no history of anxiety/depression and have never felt this way before. I am not even close to suicidal thoughts or any self-harm. \\n\\nI was able to sit with my Dad and talk for a few hours while watching the Red Sox then have Sunday dinner at my grandma\\'s with my whole family and that helped a lot and by the end of Sunday/Monday I was feeling better (though the oral thrush is still annoying).\\n\\nToday I had some restlessness/anxiety at work that started resurfacing again like on Sunday but talked to a co-worker who used to struggle big time with it for a bit. \\n\\nIs this normal after surgery?

I need some advice/help (Gonna be a little long, gonna rant a bit)\\n\\nLittle back story, 20-year-old male, no past history of major anxiety other than flying on planes etc..\\n\\nLast year from January to April was feeling the best I have ever felt in my life! worked out 6-7 days a week, confidence was high, and not a care in the world. I would say around May, I started getting increasingly fatigued every day. As the days went on, it felt like I was detached from reality. By the end of the year, I felt so detached, fatigued, and had major brain fog. I have a small bump on the back of my head, it doesn't hurt, I got it checked out and the doc said it could be a skull deformity. I dont believe her.  I convinced myself that I had something wrong with me, and I went down the rabbit hole of self-diagnosing by reading google (i know worst idea ever). I could only function to the fraction I could before my snapping point. I felt so depolarized and had no energy at this point. I convinced myself I had a chronic illness that I was going to die from (I still belive this), I got every scan and lab work done. Nothing came of it. I had no idea what was causing all of these symptoms. Fast forward to January, I started a very stressful college class. It is an intensive academy-type class. I thought I had my stress pretty well controlled but in February I had my first panic attack ever. Went to school that day feeling fine, didn't eat breakfast, but drank 180mg of caffeine (I usually have \\\\~300mg a day). During the afternoon portion of the class, I felt this sense of impending doom, and shortness of breath and it felt like my heart was going to jump out of my chest.  For 2 hours my HR was in the \\\\~130s. I had no Idea what was going on and felt like I was gonna die. So my teacher wanted me transported to the ER, My EKG came back normal, sinus tachycardia (fast heart rate). They pulled labs and everything was normal except for low magnesium and potassium. They gave me some fluids and discharged me. For the next few days my heart rate was a constant 120 even when resting and my anxiety was through the roof! It sucked! My doctor then prescribed me Lexapro, and man oh man, hats of to anyone that could get through that first phase of Lexapro. It trashed me, constant panic attacks, SOB, tingling, the whole 9 yards. I stopped after 5 days due to the fact that I didn't want to be tied to a pill at such a young age. Since my panic attack, Ive had constant anxiety. Im having anxiety about things Ive never worried about before! it sucks! Its like I have to experience all these things over again (like driving) to tell myself there is nothing to be anxious about. Ill also be sitting in the most comfortable place in my house, not stressed at all, then my heart rate will kick off to the \\\\~120s for the whole day. Do you guys experience this? I also feel like I'm having heart palpitations. It feels like my heart is in my throat and I can't catch my breath. It sucks! Every time I stand up my heart rate jumps. It takes a long time for me to calm down and convince myself I'm not dying. I know my case is minor to some cases Ive read but damn Im having a hard time with this. Im in constant fear and anxious about having another anxiety attack and passing out. Im trying everything I can before I commit to an antidepressant. Im trying L  theanine, Ashwagandha, and magnesium. I got prescribed adarax but it doesn't seem to help like ativan does. I just want my old life back. Is this normal? Does it get better? will it be like this forever? how did you guys get over your anxiety? tips? medications? Thank you all for taking time and reading my post I really appreciate it.

I can’t keep a job. I either quit after a short while, or in this instance, get chucked out. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSince then I’ve avoided work all together as all I feel is bitterness and shame. Another deterrent is how I’m not good at anything in particular. All I can get are shit jobs where I’m completely replaceable. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI’m too shy and anxious all the time, so talking to people is really hard. When I worked at a cinema it wasn’t too bad because there were people my age and I felt good talking to them, but that job went to pieces because management hated me (long story). \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI’m told to get a skill, but the idea of getting a trade sounds harrowing to me as I’ve worked on construction sites and the people who work there are usually abrasive cokeheads who I really wouldn’t get along with/tolerate. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAll I’ve done for the past year is read, write, listen to music and occasionally socialise but I’m pretty much alone now. I guess when you’re socially isolated it’s hard to really know yourself, like you can’t test yourself much in a public setting so it’s hard to truly know who you are. I find it hard sometimes. Just thinking about what jobs would suit me, it seems impossible. I know what I don’t want to do, but that’s pretty much everything to be honest. The idea of working a job again, commuting, forcing myself to speak to people who I don’t want to be around, and doing these mundane things feels like death isn’t so bad. Considering the sort of jobs I can get, which are garbage service jobs or low-skilled office one’s with high turnovers. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo I’m stuck. I feel really trapped.

I’m scared of telling anyone my problems as I was always told they’re insignificant and I should “man up” (even though the same people who told me that complain and talk about how bad their lives are all the time to me and never ask about how I’m doing).

I have symptoms but they are not typical hyperthyroid sometimes and now I have this history of that one time it actually WAS something. Graves’ disease isn’t that serious considering the big picture, though. And I did something incredibly stupid. I did a 23 and me health analysis thing. Major dumb. I don’t even have the results yet but here I go. I guarantee I will suddenly have 100 more diseases by the end of next month. And I know that one time, I was right. Something was wrong.

So I started to consume codeine once in a few weeks in order to be able to function correctly, since I've tried around 20 antidepressants and SSRIs and nothing worked for me.\\n\\nYesterday, I took another dose. I buy OTC pain relief pills which contain codeine phosphate but they also contain paracetamol (acetaminophen) and aspirin and, in order to stay safe, you need to do a cold water extraction in order to remove the acetaminophen and aspirin from the pills. Opioids are highly soluble in water, so the codeine dissolves and the other ingredients  get filtered through a fabric and removed from the water, leaving a crystal-clear substance containing just codeine. However, I was in a hurry yesterday (stupid excuse to overlook my safety, I know) and I didn't wait long enough for the water to reach the right temperature (it needs to be around freezing temperature, but not frozen) and I did the extraction anyway. The water came out very milky and that is a sign that the extraction was not successful. I didn't know the water needs to be COMPLETELY clear and I didn't look it up...I took the substance anyway.\\n\\nA few hours later I did some reserch and found out that I might have potentially intested 4 grams of paracetamol and 5 grams or aspirin. 4 grams of paracetamol is a risky amount, because it can cause liver damage.
